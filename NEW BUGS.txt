ERROR WHEN CREATING NEW USERS PASSWORD
FIX IN ALL USERS



Attempting to fix doc user so that placed / completed and old orders only show orders that that doctor placed
But because the insert statment for create orders uses the referralmds table pk the userid gained from logging in no longer works
Cole will need to add a query to the referral mds home page to convert the userid into the id needed to track the current user.
Then we can add a filter to orders Where ID = referralmds.id
