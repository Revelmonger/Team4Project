(Persona, Scenario, User Story):

Debbie, age 58, is an arson investigator in Forsyth county, a decent sized county in the north-central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. She investigates
crimes committed with fire and finds out who did them and for what reason these crimes were committed. She was born in the same state as which she works
and has moved around to various parts of the state growing up. She only has a highschool degree education and has worked her way up in the ranks through 
sheer hard work and persistance. Debbie recently fractured her foot on the job and needs an examination from a radiologist. Debbie now must have to call in, must go to the front desk, or go online into the software and get 
scheduled in by entering in her personal information. She has very little interest in the overall workings of the technology used to recieve an exam, and has a general knowledge base of technological 
experience enough to navigate through requiredpatient information collecting and scheduling systems but nothing too advanced. As a guest, she simply would like to enter in her information into a non-complex 
user interfaceand schedule and recieve an exam from the radiologist.
