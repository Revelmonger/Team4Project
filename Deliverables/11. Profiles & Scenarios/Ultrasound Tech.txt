Ultrasound Tech -
Jasmine is a 27 year old Ultrasound tech living in Barrow County by herself as she focuses on paying back her student loans. She graduated from a technical school with an Ultrasound degree and decided on this carrer path because it made more money than being a midwife. Jasmine wakes up every day at 5:30 am and leaves for work to be there at 7 when the radiology department is open for day outpatients. The system she used with her training at another nearby hospital group was much newer and refined for the different modalities. Jasmine’s job requires her to be able to actively scan and read the image at the same time while doing an Ultrasound so being able to create voice logs or write a report inside the imaging system of the RIS would be great. Since Jasmine writes the radiology report herself and only need the radiologist to write off on it she thinks having the new system being able to expedite that would save alot of time in overhead and allow her to take lunch more often. 
Scenario for previous system - 
Jasmine wishes the new system being implemented would have a separate log in for the ultrasound and other radiology sub-departments. The current systems interface is covered with clutter from tools used by other Radiology departments.
