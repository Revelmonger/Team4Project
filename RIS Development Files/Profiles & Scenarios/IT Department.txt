Linda is a 45 yr old IT department head for the local hospital in Nashville, TN. She was born and raised in Nashville and even attended Belmont University and got her Master’s in computer science. However, both her parents died in a car crash before seeing her graduate from college. She is married with 3 children that are all still in elementary school. Her husband is employed as the vice president of a software company specializing in coding for video games.

She had always had a knack for computers, but never saw it as a career opportunity until dropping her original Associate degree in marine biology. She started out just maintaining small amounts of coding in the hospital when she was 30, but has now moved to the head of her department.

The current system is being changed to that of a new interface for the radiologist and doctors. She is now in charge of maintaining communication between both parties. While she was used to the old system, the new system offers up more easy paths in which to solve any issues with the code. The more direct line of communication is a little more difficult to maintain, but she is still continuing to learn.
