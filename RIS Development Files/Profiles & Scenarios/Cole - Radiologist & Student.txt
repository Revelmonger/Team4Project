Emma, 38, is a radiologist from Atlanta, Georgia. She has completed medical school as well 
as her residency and is now relatively experienced in the field. She is familiar enough 
with computers to do basic tasks that relate to her work, such as work with excel and word 
documents. Within the RIS, she wants to be able to easily receive whatever imaging she needs, 
easily distinguish which patient and images are which, and be able to see the imaging clearly. 
She also wants to annotate the images with her thoughts and diagnosis and allow other physicians 
and the patient to view it.

Jack, 22, is a student looking to get into the medical field. He is currently working as a transporter 
in a hospital to gain an understanding of how a hospital runs. Within the RIS, he wants to be able to easily 
view the patient’s name, which modality they require, and where they should go to be serviced.
